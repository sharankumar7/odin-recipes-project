    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The exact origin of the dish is uncertain, however, it has been suggested that it originated in Persia. In North
        India, there are different varieties of biryani developed over time.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>half kg chicken (1.1 lbs.)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons plain yogurt (Indian curd)</li>
        <li>1¼ tablespoons ginger garlic paste</li>
        <li>½ to 1 tablespoon garam masala (or biriyani masala)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>½ to 1 teaspoon red chili powder (reduce for kids)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice (optional)</li>
        <li>2 cup basmati reciepes</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>This recipe needs half kg chicken (1.1 lbs.). Make few slits on all the chicken pieces and add to a large
            bowl.Then add all the required spices.listed above in the ingredients</li>
        <li>Mix everything well and marinate the chicken. Cover and set this aside for 1 hour. You can also rest it
            overnight in the
            fridge.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile add 2 cups basmati rice to a large pot and rinse it at least thrice. Drain and soak in fresh water
            for 30
            mins. Drain to a colander after 30 mins. Optional – Soak a pinch of saffron strands in 2 tablespoons hot
            milk.</li>
        <li>Heat ghee or oil in a heavy bottom pot or pressure cooker. Make sure you use a large one for this. Using
            whole spices is
            optional but recommended. Use whatever you have. I use
            <ul>
                <li>1 bay leaf
                </li>
                <li>4 green cardamoms
                </li>
                <li>6 cloves
                </li>
                <li>1 inch cinnamon piece
                </li>
                <li>1 star anise
                </li>
                <li>¾ teaspoon shahi jeera (caraway seeds)
                </li>
                <li>1 strand mace (optional, omit if you don’t like)
                </li>
            </ul>


        </li>
        <li>Add thinly sliced onions. On a medium heat, fry them stirring often until uniformly light brown.</li>
        <li>Turn them into golden brown color. Do not burn them as they leave a bitter taste.</li>
        <li>Add marinated chicken & saute until it becomes pale for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Lower the flame completely. Cover and cook until the chicken is soft, tender and completely cooked.</li>
        <li>Check if the chicken is cooked by pricking with a fork or knife. It has to be just cooked and not overdone.
            Evaporate
            any excess moisture left in the pot by cooking further without the lid.</li>
        <li>Taste test and add more salt if needed. I added ¼ more salt here. Add
            <ul>
                <li>¼ cup plain yogurt (Indian curd)
                </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon garam masala (or biryani masala)
                </li>
                <li>¼ to ½ teaspoon red chili powder (optional)
                </li>
                <li>1 slit green chili pepper (optional)
                </li>
                <li>2 tablespoons chopped mint leaves (pudina)
                </li>

            </ul>


        </li>
        <li>Mix everything well. Spread it evenly in a single layer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Layer drained rice all over the chicken. To a separate pot, pour 3 cups water and add ¼ to ½ teaspoon
            salt. If cooking
            in a pot (not cooker), start with 3 cups water at this stage.

            Stir and taste the water. It must be slightly salty. Bring the water to a rolling boil. Pour 2 cups of
            this hot water
            across the sides of the cooker or pot. Pour rest of the water over the rice gently

        </li>
        <li>Level the rice gently on top. Add 2 tablespoons more mint leaves.Do not mix up everything, the taste of the
            biryani
            cooked in the shown method is good. Optionally you can sprinkle 2 tablespoons fried onions & saffron soaked
            milk.</li>
        <li>Finally cover the pot or cooker.</li>
        <li>When the pressure releases naturally, open the lid. Gently fluff up with a fork.</li>
        <li>Serve chicken biryani in layers – top layer with rice and bottom layer with chicken. Enjoy with raita or
            shorba.</li>
